Intro
-----

This is a statement about the integrity of this blog or its
“blogtegrity”. I saw this idea on [Phil Haack's blog](http://haacked.com/)
and liked it, so I'm borrowing the concept and applying it my blog as well.

Simply put, this is a promise that any content of this blog under my control
is, to the best of my knowledge, genuine, truthful, and honest. The obvious
exception is of course any satire I may write.

Independent
-----------

The intent is to clearly establish that this blog represents an independent
opinion and is <abbr title="owing thanks or having a duty to someone in return for help or a service">beholden</abbr>
to no other interests other than my own. Any time I write about something 
that might represent a conflict of interest, I will make such conflicts clear.

Comments
--------

I can't (and won't) vouch for the comments left by others. Unless I feel a
comment is SPAM or completely off topic (as in comment graffiti), I generally
leave them alone.

Endorsements and Advertising
----------------------------

I will not personally endorse a product, company, or service that I
haven’t personally experienced and believe in. That said, just because
I once endoresed a product doesn't necessarily mean that I still endorse it.
At times, I may mention that a trusted person I know recommends something, 
but I will not endorse that product or service unless I have tried it out myself.

I have advertising on my blog; however, the ads are automatically
determined by the ad publisher. I neither endorse nor control the 
products and services mentioned in those ads. I have full editorial control over my
content and they are not influenced by advertising.

Mistakes
--------

I reserve the right to occasionally make mistakes concerning this promise. In that case,
I promise to promptly and noticeably correct any mistakes brought to my attention
and have no problem admitting them.

If any significant changes to this promise (apart from
fixing typos, grammar, etc.), I’ll be sure to mention it in my blog.
