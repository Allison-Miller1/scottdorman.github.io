Thanks to the UserVoice team for enabling custom statuses on [Windows Phone Marketplace Requests](http://wprequests.uservoice.com/)! I have added a few additional statuses (I’m still working out exactly what makes the most sense), but the biggest change is to the Declined status.

Previously, when a request was marked as Declined, all voting was closed. I was using this status for several different reasons:

*   To show that the request was off-topic, either because it belonged on the Windows Phone Suggestion Box or because it was a feature/enhancement request to an existing application.
*   To show that the request was too general in nature. (I’m still working on the best way to handle these.)
*   To show that the company in question has officially announced they have no current plans to develop a Windows Phone version.  

As you can imagine, using this status for the last reason is actually a problem. Since voting was closed, you couldn’t continue to show your support of the request. This has now changed so that when a request is marked as Declined, **you can still vote on it**. This allows me to clearly indicate the company has no plans for a Windows Phone version while still allowing everyone to continue voting for the request.

In addition, I have created an Off-Topic status and moved all of the real off-topic requests into this status instead of using the Declined status. This also makes it easier to find requests that are actually declined as opposed to off-topic, as you can see below.

This should make the site a bit easier to navigate and (hopefully) a bit easier to manage as well.
