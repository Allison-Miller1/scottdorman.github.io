One of the cooler "eye-candy" type effects possible with WPF is the ability to create reflections. Reflections can be made of pretty much anything and are relatively simple to create. There is a good [tutorial](http://www.contentpresenter.com/LiveReflection.wmv) on creating reflections using [Visual Studio](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx) and [Microsoft Expression Blend](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/default.mspx).

The drawback to creating reflections is that you have to repeat the steps for every reflection. Fortunately, one of the developers at Infragistics has created a [custom control](http://blogs.infragistics.com/blogs/grant_hinkson/archive/2007/01/14/wpf-reflection-control.aspx) that allows you to easily create reflections. I have used this control... it works reasonably well and sure beats doing the reflections by hand.
