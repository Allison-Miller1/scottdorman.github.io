> “This isn’t a fantasy world. It’s a world like Earth. Power here is based on ignorance. On superstition. On deception. Not on magic. Not on anything mystical or paranormal. This ‘power’ wielded by the Hood is rooted, deeply rooted, in pure, blind fear.”

StormScape is a new Science Fiction/Fantasy book published by Joe Wells, who happens to be a friend of mine. The book was just [published](http://www.lulu.com/content/646547 "http://www.lulu.com/content/646547") on [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/) late last month. If you like sci-fi books, this one is well worth it. I'm looking forward to the release of Book 2, although I have no idea when that will be.
