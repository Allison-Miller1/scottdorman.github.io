There is always a lot of interest around my desk at work any time I change the color schemes in Visual Studio. I usually bounce between the default "light" color scheme and a "dark" scheme, mostly depending on much actual coding I'm doing at the moment, but sometimes just because I want a change. It isn't always easy to come up with a good color scheme and there isn't a good location online to collect the various color schemes people have created.

Today, I came across a link on [Charlie Calvert](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2007/12/10/community-convergence-xxxvii.aspx)'s blog that referenced a collection of [Visual Studio color schemes](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/CategoryView,category,VS%2BColor%2BScheme.aspx) that Tomas Restrepo has put together. I think this is a great idea and a great collection of color schemes. The organization isn't the easiest to follow since it's just a bunch of different blog posts, but there are a lot of good color schemes available. I'm going to have to sit down with them when I have some more time and see if I can find a new scheme that I like.
