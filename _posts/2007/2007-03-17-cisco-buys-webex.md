According to [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2104366,00.asp?kc=EWNAVEMNL031607EOAD), Cisco Systems just announced that it is buying WebEx Communications for $2.9B. The total deal is worth $3.2B including WebEx's existing cash reserves, and will be Cisco's biggest acquisition since it bought Scientific-Atlanta last year for $7B.

The deal is a natural fit for Cisco as it expands it's unified communications and telepresence offerings and is expected to close sometime in late July, at the end of Cisco's fiscal fourth quarter.
