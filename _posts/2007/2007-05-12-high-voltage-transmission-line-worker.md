And you thought your job was dangerous?

Seriously, these guys (and girls?) have what I would consider to be an extremely stressful and dangerous job and one that is completely taken for granted. This holds not only for the guy traveling around the wires, but also for the helicopter pilots, who must have rock-steady nerves to hold the helo still that close to the wires.

How often do you think about what it takes to maintain the high voltage lines that all of us depend so much on...and how quickly do we criticize the power companies when something goes wrong and we loose power, even as the result of storm damage. Maybe this will make us all take a second thought next time.
