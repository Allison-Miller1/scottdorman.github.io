Earlier this month, I posted a [summary](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/02/17/106567.aspx) of the [technical tracks](http://www.msteched.com/public/tracks.aspx) available for Tech·Ed 2007. As I was putting the summary together, I noticed that WPF was not listed. Well, [Rob Relyea,](http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com/) the PM on the WPF team noticed my [post](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/02/17/106568.aspx "Tech·Ed Technical Tracks - Where's WPF-") and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is now officially listed under the "Developer Tools and Technologies" track.
