Courtesy of [Snap.com](http://www.snap.com/), I came across [Site Meter](http://www.sitemeter.com/), which provides comprehensive real time website tracking and counter tools give you instant access to vital information and data about your sites audience. With our detailed reporting you'll have a clear picture of who is visiting your site, how they found you, where they came from, what interests them and much more.

Site Meter provides some of the same statistics counting as [ClustrMaps](http://www.clustrmaps.com/), but also provides a lot more details, similar to what you can get with some of the [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) reports.

I've added a Site Meter to my blog, so I'll have to keep an eye on it.
