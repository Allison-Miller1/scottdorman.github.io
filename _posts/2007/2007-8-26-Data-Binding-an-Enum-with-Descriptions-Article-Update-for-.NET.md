Recently, I [posted](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/12/Data-Binding-an-Enum-with-Descriptions-on-Code-Project.aspx) an article on Code Project about data binding an enumerated type with support for custom and localizable descriptionsÂ to any UI element that supports data binding. It was pointed out in the article comments that this class is a perfect candidate for [.NET 3.5 extension methods](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/20/C-3.0-Extension-Methods-Follow-Up.aspx). I have just updated the [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/enumdatabinding.asp) to show how easy it is to convert the methods to be extension methods.
