I have finally turned my previous [post]({% post_url 2007-04-06-detecting-installed-net-framework-versions-and-service-packs-update %}) in to a new [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/iisdetection.asp) on Code Project. This article provides a definitive way to determine which version of IIS is installed, what IIS subcomponents are installed, and also if ASP or ASP.NET has been registered with IIS.

This article provides a single class that encapsulates the various methods required for determining this information.
