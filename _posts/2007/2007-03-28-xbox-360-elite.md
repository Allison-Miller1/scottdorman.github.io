Microsoft just announced the [Xbox 360 Elite](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360elite/default.htm) gaming console. The Elite version has a price tag of $479.99 and includes the following:

*   Xbox 360 Elite console
*   *   Premium black finish
    *   3 core processors
    *   1080p support, 16:9 cinematic aspect ratio
    *   anti-aliasing
    *   full surround sound
    *   HDMI output
    *   DVD playback with upscaling capabilities Xbox 360 120GB hard drive
*   Xbox 360 Wireless Controller (black)
*   Xbox 360 headset for Xbox LIVE (black) 

The Elite package is rumored to be available at the end of April.

This version still uses the same 90nm chip technology as the other Xbox 360 consoles. They will all change to the 65nm technology when it is ready.

Also, in order to keep cost down, the Elite package will **not** include an HD-DVD drive. This should be available as an add-on/upgrade, which is the same as the other consoles.

The biggest changes are the larger hard drive (which can be separately purchased as well), the 1080p support, and the HDMI output. Other than that, it's just a regular Xbox 360 with a black skin and controller. I don't think it will effectively compete against the Sony [PS3](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3) (except in price) or against the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/) as it doesn't include any DVR-like features. Maybe the "Xbox 720" will.
