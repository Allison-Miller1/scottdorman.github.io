Just as my [last post]({% post_url /2007/2007-05-10-teched-2007-session-calendars %}) was publishing, I realized that many people might not know about the Internet Calendar Subscriptions in Outlook 2007 or may still be using Outlook 2003.

[Michael Affronti](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_affronti/default.aspx), the Outlook Program Manager, has a great [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_affronti/archive/2006/05/10/594986.aspx) describing Internet Calendar Subscriptions and how you can interact with them in Outlook 2007. For those of you who are still using Outlook 2003, there is an [open-source add-in](http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotecalendars) that allows you to work with Internet Calendars.
