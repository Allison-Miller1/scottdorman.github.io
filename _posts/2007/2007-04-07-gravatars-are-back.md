For those of you who don't know, a gravatar is a **g**lobally **r**ecognized **avatar**. This is an image that follows you from blog to blog and appears next to your name when on you comment on gravatar enabled sites. In general, gravatars help identify your posts on blogs in much the same way as a normal avatar does for web forums.

The gravatar site had been down for a long time, causing speculation that it was shutting down. Those rumors have turned out to be absolutely untrue, and the Gravatar [site](http://site.gravatar.com/) is back online and ready for new users. In the downtime, the site has been improved with new features and better scalability. 

Signing up for a gravatar account is free and the only information you need to provide is your email address. Once you've signed up, you can upload an image to use as your avatar. Staying with the free signup you get one email address per account and are limited to 2 gravatars per account. You can also upgrade to a premium account for only $10 per year and get unlimited emails and gravatars per account.
