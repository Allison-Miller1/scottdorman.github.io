> ClustrMaps is the *only* hit counter that (i) accurately shows you the locations of all visitors to your site on a thumbnail map embedded in your page, (ii) uses dot-clusters that scale up to huge numbers, and (iii) lets you store old maps in an archive.

Well, I finally took the plunge and added a ClutrMaps counter to my blog. Since I started this blog almost 9 months ago, I have seen referrals from all of the world (most through Google and other search engines). It has been cool knowing that my little corner of the world has been seen in countries such as Finland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Thailand, just to name a few. Of course, since ClustrMaps can't record previous history you'll just have to take my word for it for now.
