I have finally turned my previous [post](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/03/01/107732.aspx) in to a new [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/iisdetection.asp) on Code Project. This article provides a definitive way to determine which version of IIS is installed, what IIS subcomponents are installed, and also if ASP or ASP.NET has been registered with IIS.

This article provides a single class that encapsulates the various methods required for determining this information.
