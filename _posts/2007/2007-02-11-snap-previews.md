I have added Snap Previews for all of the external links on the site. The preview will only trigger when the mouse hovers over the preview icon![](/img/posts/{{ page.id }}/o_iconLink.gif), so hopefully it won't be too intrusive. There is also an "opt in" badge located in the "News" column that lets you turn previews on. Once they are turned on, you can turn them off again through the options link available from any preview.

It does look like there are a few issues with the previews where some sites are not being displayed. I'm not sure if this is simply because the Snap servers haven't crawled those sites yet or if it is an actual bug. I'll wait a day or two before asking Snap about this.
