The Orlando CodeCamp is basically a free one day conference for and by the community. Last year we had 7 tracks with over 45 speakers and 300 attendees present. This event is the MUST attend event of the year if you are a .NET developer or architect in Central Florida. If you would like to speak or make a donation please let me know (shawn@shawnweisfeld.com). All event information can be found on the CodeCamp Website:

I've always wanted to go to one of the CodeCamps but haven't been able to. Now that it is practically in my back yard, I'm going! (I missed last year's Orlando CodeCamp.) See you there!
