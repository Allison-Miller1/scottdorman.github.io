I received an email today from Snap letting me know about a contest they are running to help improve Snap Preview Anywhere (SPA).

They have already started making improvementsÂ  and are looking for ideas on how to make things even better. Since there are over 650,000 websites and blogs that use SPA, it shouldn't be hard to get a lot of good ideas. The hard part will be sifting through them to find the ones that can actually be done. So far, there are 57 entries.

The top 3 ideas submitted will win $2500, $1000, and $500 respectively. The top two comments will each win $500. 

See the [contest site](http://contest.snap.com) for official rules and regulations. The contest ends March 15, 2007, so there isn't much time left to submit your ideas.
