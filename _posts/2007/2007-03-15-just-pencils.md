I was recently sent an email that has some of the most amazing pictures. ~~~I have uploaded them to the Just Pencils gallery. The thumbnail images in the gallery really don't do these justice, so be sure to view the full size image.~~~

Keep in mind, all of these creations are done using just the tips or ends of colored drawing pencils. And I always thought they were just for writing.

~~~If anyone knows how the artist is, please let me know so I can give him or her credit for these amazing creations.~~~ [See this post: [Just Pencils! a subscript...]({% post_url 2007-03-17-just-pencils-a-subscript %})]
