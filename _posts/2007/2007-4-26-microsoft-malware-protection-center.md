The portal officially launches in early July and will have additional features such as malware sample submission. In the meantime, it lists things such as the most active families and variants for malware, most active email threats, and the top adware/spyware removed.

It also provides links to download the latest defintions for Windows Defender and Microsoft Forefront Client Security.

It will be interesting to watch this portal over the rest of the year. It has a lot of potential and is certainly visually appealing, but how will it compare to more mature portals like the [Sunbelt Counterspy Research Center](http://research.sunbelt-software.com/). While not as visually appealing as Microsoft's portal, it certainly has more information and a very extensive malware catalog.
