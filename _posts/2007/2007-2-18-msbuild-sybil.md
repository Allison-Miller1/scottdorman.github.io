As I was writing my previous [post](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/02/18/106630.aspx), I found an odd spelling correction suggested by the Windows Live Writer spell checker. It would appear that the suggested spelling for MSBuild is [Sybil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Ardell_Mason). That might just explain things.
