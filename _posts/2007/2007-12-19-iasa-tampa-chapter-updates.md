Last month's meeting with Cory Foy was excellent. [Cory Foy](http://www.cornetdesign.com ) talked about concepts from Michael Feathers' work on [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://amzn.to/28M7yS6) and I presented a quick introduction and overview to the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller) and MVP patterns. We had about 15 people attending which was down a bit from October's meeting but we did have a few new faces as well.

Just a reminder, there will be no meeting in December due to the holidays. The next meeting will be the end of January and should feature [Ron Jacobs](http://blogs.msdn.com/rjacobs/). We are still looking for someone to present an introduction and overview of another design pattern. If you're interested let me know.
