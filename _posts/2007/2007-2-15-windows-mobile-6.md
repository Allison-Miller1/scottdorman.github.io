Microsoft just announced Windows Mobile 6 ([press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/feb07/02-11WM6SoftwarePR.mspx)) at the [3GSM World Conference](http://3gsmworldcongress.com/) in Barcelona, Spain. The first WM6 powered devices will start hitting the streets by the second quarter of this year, and many companies are planning upgrade options for existing WM5 devices.

There are a lot of changes in this release, but Microsoft has really focused on improving usability and adding support for ![](http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/02/wm6-professional-hands-on-107.jpg) more Microsoft Office features. The user interface has received a much needed face-lift, giving it more of a Vista style look with smooth gradient blends and better 3D graphics. A very complete review is available on [mobile-review](http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/articles/wm-crossbow-en.shtml).

The most interesting feature is that this version of Windows Mobile will support Windows Update, which is a big departure from Microsoft's past position on updating the operating system. This release will also come with the .NET Compact Framework 2.0 SP1 and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition installed in the ROM.

There is a great overview showing [What's New for Developers in Windows Mobile 6](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb278115.aspx "What's New for Developers in Windows Mobile 6") on MSDN. The biggest change is that with this release, the naming conventions have changed. We now have Windows Mobile 6 Standard, Professional, and Classic editions along with two new SDKs (Standard and Professional). Confused yet?

The Windows Mobile 6 Standard edition uses the Windows Mobile 6 Standard SDK, so this is a one-to-one mapping and replaces Windows Mobile 5 for Smartphone.

Windows Mobile 6 Professional and Classic editions both use the Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK. The replacements are:

> Windows Mobile 5 for Pocket PC Phone Edition -> Windows Mobile 6 Professional
> 
> Windows Mobile 5 for Pocket PC -> Windows Mobile 6 Classic

Personally, I think these are backwards as WM5 for Pocket PC has a lot more features and is much more business professional oriented than WM5 for Pocket PC Phone Edition.

The key difference is that Windows Mobile 6 Professional and Classic editions are for devices that have touch screen support. Windows Mobile 6 Standard is for devices that do not have a touch screen.

Overall, the new version looks really nice and I can't wait to upgrade to it. No, it doesn't compare with the very slick and polished interface on the Apple [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) (or whatever it will ultimately be [called](http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/01/apple-and-cisco-agree-to-delay-lawsuit-maybe-hug-it-out/)). I do know that the Windows Mobile development team is already working on the next release of Windows Mobile, which possibly will be out and in devices by this time next year.
