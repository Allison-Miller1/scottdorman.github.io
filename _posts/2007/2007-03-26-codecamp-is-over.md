and my blog was referenced in one of the talks that I happened to attend.

I was duly surprised when I saw my [WPF Datagrid control]({% post_url 2007-02-06-wpf-datagrid-control %}) post popup on the overhead and see it listed on the references slide. I must say, it was pretty cool.

Overall, I think my first CodeCamp experience (seeing my blog "up in lights" not-withstanding) was very good. It was well organized and had just over 300 people attending. The topic coverage and speakers were also great. I would definitely go to another one, which should be in Tampa sometime soon.
