[Simone Chiaretta](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz "Climbing the cliffs of C#") has just released a beta version of his new [Vista Sidebar Gadget for monitoring Cruise Control.NET](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/04/17/Vista-Gadget-for-CruiseControl.NET---CC.NET-Monitor-for-Vista-Sidebar.aspx). This gadget uses the CC.NET [REST-like API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST "REST-like API") and connects to the XmlStatusReport service that comes as part of CC.NET.

The look of the gadget is excellent, and provides the same monitoring capabilities currently available in the CCTray application. The next release should hopefully add the ability to force a build. It would be great if this ability is available from both the docked (via a context menu on the project) and the undocked views. Providing a way to go to the latest build report would be a good addition as well.
