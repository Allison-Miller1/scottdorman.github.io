title: Subtext CruiseControl.NET dashboard facelift

The Subtext CruiseControl.NET dashboard has undergone a major facelift this weekend. It now has a new CNAME record, which allows access to it from:

> [http://build.subtextproject.com/ccnet/](http://build.subtextproject.com/ccnet/)

This change is the beginning of an effort to enhance the documentation for the project and make it easier for users to find everything.

To go along with the new address, the dashboard itself received a huge overhaul as well. It now sports a nice, clean feel that matches the main Subtext project [site](http://www.subtextproject.com/). There are still a few nips and tucks to do, but the major surgery is over.
