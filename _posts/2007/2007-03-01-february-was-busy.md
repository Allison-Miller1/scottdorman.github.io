All I can say is, "Wow!" I just looked at my blog and realized that I posted 34 posts for last month. I'm sure some of you may not think this is a large amount, but for me it represented the single busiest month of blogging since I started almost a year ago.

I don't know how busy I'll be blogging this month, but I know I will be busy. Here is my current list of projects (outside of real work, that is):

<ol>
<li>Update my [File Downloader](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/filedownloader.asp?msg=1919280 "An easy to use URL file downloader class for .NET") component with asynchronous download support. 
<li>Update my [Framework Version Detection](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp?msg=1903766 "Using managed code to detect what .NET Framework versions and service packs are installed") component with support for detecting if ASP.NET is registered with IIS and which language packs are installed on the .NET Framework v1.1 
<li>Write a new article on implementing a LabelProvider component for .NET 2.0. 
<li>Finish updating the skin for the [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) CruiseControl.NET [dashboard](http://haacked.dyndns.org/ccnet/). 
<li>Start enhancing and updating the Subtext Wiki and looking for a more permanent hosting solution. (Anyone want to volunteer hosting space?) 
<li>Update my [XFN Link Editor](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=217b89d0-30cb-4370-958e-f22307173ae0&l=8) plugin for Windows Live Writer with support for a "most recently used" list. 
<li>Finish updating the web services API documentation for [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/). 
<li>Finish the reference application for the Community Credit web services. 
<li>Continue working on a WPF application for historical biblical text comparisons, as part of the [Sahidica](http://www.sahidica.com/ "The Egyptian New Testament") project. 
<li>Start the requirements gathering for a new project (can't say what it is yet) with some old friends from when I worked in North Carolina.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>


I'm sure there are a few projects that I've forgotten about that are supposed to be on this list as well. Hopefully, it won't get any longer as the month progresses. My goal is to get at least half of these done by the end of theÂ month, but I'm not holding my breath.
