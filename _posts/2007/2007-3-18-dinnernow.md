Microsoft has a released a new technology showcase site called [Dinner Now](http://www.dinnernow.net/). From the website:

> DinnerNow is a fictious [sic.]Â marketplace where customers can order food from local restaurants for delivery to their home or office. This sample is designed to demonstrate how you can develop a connected application using several new Microsoft technologies.
> 
> The demo utilizes several technologies including: IIS7, ASP.NET Ajax Extensions, Linq, Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Powershell, and the .NET Compact Framework.
> 
> The DinnerNow sample application is now available for download. You can download the entire DinnerNow sample code from [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/dinnernow/release/projectreleases.aspx).

There is a 6 minute video that showcases the technology from the customer's point of view. It looks very promising and should really showcase the power and integration between all of these technologies. The feeling I get is that this is the new showcase application that will replace the [Task Vision](http://www.windowsforms.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=4&tabid=49) sample application available from [Windows Forms .NET](http://www.windowsforms.net/).
