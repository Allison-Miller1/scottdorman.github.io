title: Data Binding an Enum with Descriptions on Code Project

I decided to turn my blog [post](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/02/Data-Binding-an-Enum-with-Descriptions.aspx) on data binding an enum into an [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/enumdatabinding.asp) on Code Project as well. I did this for two reasons:

1.  It gives the topic a much wider audience
2.  It provides a ready to use solution with the source code so you don't have to copy & paste it from the blog entry 

This article (or blog post) should provide a clean and simple way to allow you to bind an enumerated type with support for custom and localizable descriptionsÂ to any UI element that supports data binding.
