I try not to post things that aren't technical like this, but every once in a while something comes my way that just stands out and is so impressive that I make an exception. These were video clips sent to me by family and both of these performances are truly amazing. 

This is a hand shadow show by [Raymond Crowe](http://www.raymondcrowe.com/), set to the music of "**What a Wonderful World**" as sung by [Louis Armstrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong).

This is a video of the french mime Jerome Murat. I'm not usually much for mimes, but this is absolutely incredible performance. (This is taken from what sounds like an awards show on French television, so the commentary is in French...but you don't need to understand what is being said to enjoy the performance.)
