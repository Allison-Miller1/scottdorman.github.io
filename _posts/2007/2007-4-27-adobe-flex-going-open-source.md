According to [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0%2C1895%2C2122767%2C00.asp?kc=EWNAVEMNL042707EOAD), Adobe Systems has announced that the Flex Web framework is being released to the open source community. Flex is a framework for building cross-platform rich internet applications for the web and also enables the new [Adobe Apollo](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/) applications for the desktop.

The next release of Flex, code-named "Moxie",Â will be released sometime in the second half of 2007 under the Mozilla Public License (MPL). However, in June the first public pre-release version will be released and Adobe will provide daily public builds as well as a public bug database. The Flex SDK and other Flex products will continue to be available under their existing commercial licenses as well.

This move by Adobe is most likely in direct response to Microsoft's official release of [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/asp/default.aspx) earlier this month.
