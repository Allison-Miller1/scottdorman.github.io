I was recently sent an email that has some of the most amazing pictures. <strike>I have uploaded them to the Just Pencils gallery. The thumbnail images in the gallery really don't do these justice, so be sure to view the full size image.</strike>

Keep in mind, all of these creations are done using just the tips or ends of colored drawing pencils. And I always thought they were just for writing.

<strike>If anyone knows how the artist is, please let me know so I can give him or her credit for these amazing creations.</strike> [See this post: [Just Pencils! a subscript...](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/03/17/109069.aspx)]
