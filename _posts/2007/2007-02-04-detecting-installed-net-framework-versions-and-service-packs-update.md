title: Detecting installed .NET Framework versions and service packs, update

Based on some of the article comments, I have just posted an update to this [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp) on Code Project. The update includes support for the January CTP of Orcas, currently called .NET Framework v3.5 and also adds methods to get the actual version number and the Windows Foundation library (WPF, WCF, WF, and CardSpace) information. 

I have also changed the title to "Using managed code to detect what .NET Framework versions and service packs are installed". Hopefully the title change won't cause any problems.
