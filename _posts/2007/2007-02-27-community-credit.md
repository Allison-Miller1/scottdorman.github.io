A while ago I posted a [entry]({% post_url /2006/2006-11-29-community-credit %}) about [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/). I don't remember what the membership count was when I joined, but it's almost at 7000 members now! I don't know if there is an official record of the most number of new users in a day, but it would be cool if the site could it the 7000 mark by the end of March 1st.

The nice thing about the site is that it serves as a central "clearing house" for all of your tech related accomplishments, such as blog posts, comments, discussion board posts, articles, book reviews, etc. and you can get some pretty fun prizes in the process.
