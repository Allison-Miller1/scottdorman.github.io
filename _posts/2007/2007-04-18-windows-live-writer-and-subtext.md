Jeff has updated his [original post](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2006/08/16/88158.aspx) about configuring Windows Live Writer for .Text so that it shows how to configure WLW for use with Subtext. The nice thing is that this is very simple and really just involves running through the wizard and selecting "Another weblog service" as the blog type.
