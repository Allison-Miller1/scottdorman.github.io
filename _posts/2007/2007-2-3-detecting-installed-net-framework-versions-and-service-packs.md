I have just posted a new [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp "http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp")Â on Code Project that provides the definitive way to determine which versions and service packs of the .NET Framework are installed on the client computer. 

This article provides a single class that encapsulates the various methods required for determing the version and service pack of the various .NET Framework releases and is based on information available on MSDN and [Aaron Stebner's WebLog](http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/default.aspx "Aaron Stebner's WebLog").
