I don't know about you, but my first home computer was a [Commodore VIC-20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20) longer ago than I care to admit. From there, it was a [Commodore C64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"), then a [C128](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128). After that, we got our first [IBM PC compatible,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible) a Goldstar made PC clone. I never really got in to the [Commodore Amiga,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) although the graphics and operating system where definitely ahead of it's time.

The Commodore line sort of died out in 1996 with the Amiga, and hasn't been heard in the mass-consumer market since then. That's all about to change!

The Commodore brand was acquired in late 2005 as part of a joint venture with Commodore International Corporation, Commodore Gaming hopes to re-establish the brand as a leader in the industry again.

As the name implies, they are going after the high-end gaming market, with four new gaming PCs. The top of the line Commodore XX features an Intel® Core™ 2 Extreme Quad-Core processor, an ASUS® P5N32-E nForce 680 SLI motherboard, 4GB Corsair® Dominator memory, and 2 NVIDIA® 8800 GTX SLI graphics cards. All of the cases come with interchangeable casing panels and can be completely personalized with a wide variety of custom skins.

The best part is that they all come preloaded with Windows Vista Ultimate <strong>and</strong> a C64 emulator, with more than 50 classic games.
