Jeff just recently [posted](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2007/03/23/109594.aspx) that the conversion of Geekswithblogs.net from .Text to Subtext is back underway. I am really looking forward to seeing the conversion complete. Subtext has a lot of great features and has a very active development community. I'm sure GWB will be converting to Subtext 1.9 for now, and hopefully will upgrade to 2.0 when it comes out.

As part of the conversion, Jeff is looking to not only change the look and feel for the homepage, but also update it to be more Web 2.0-ish by making it a customizable portal. Some of the ideas that he and other GWB bloggers have suggested promise to be very welcome additions.
