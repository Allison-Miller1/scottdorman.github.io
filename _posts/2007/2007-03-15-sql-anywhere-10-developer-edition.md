One of the online developer newsletters I receive is "[Application Development Trends](http://adtmag.com/)". In the most recent newsletter, they have an offer for a free download of SQL Anywhere 10 Developer Edition. I don't personally use SQL Anywhere, since I work in an all-Microsoft shop and have a couple of SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition licenses for my other work, but this sounds like a good deal. Here is the excerpt from the newsletter:

> SQL Anywhere provides data management and data exchange technologies that enable the rapid development and deployment of database-powered applications. SQL Anywhere is offered at no cost for development and testing. **Register before the 60 day evaluation expires to continue using the product free of charge for development and testing, without a time limit.** To download the product, [**click here**](http://www.1105info.com/qoeiemi_sdchxlcx.html).
