For those of you that use Windows Live Writer to publish posts you will need to reconfigure the blog settings to support Subtext. This is a one-time change and simply involves running the "Edit Weblog Settings" wizard. This wizard will pick up all of the existing settings, so you don't actually need to change anything.

One benefit that Subtext provides is that we can now publish images in the post directly...no need to upload them first.

If you aren't already running Windows Live Writer, I encourage you to download your copy today. For full instructions on how to configure it for GWB, take a look at this [post](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2006/08/24/89164.aspx).
