Redmond Developer News just published an [article](http://reddevnews.com/news/article.aspx?editorialsid=8484)Â saying that Research In Motion (RIM) will be making available later this year software that provides Windows Mobile 6 devices a "virtual" BlackBerry experience. The software will feature email, browsing, instant messaging, and other capabilities and will also let WM6 devices take advantage of BlackBerry services, such as BlackBerry Enterprise Server.

The application also provides support for the BlackBerry Mobile Data System, a feature that will enable the development of BlackBerry applications or the deployment of third-party BlackBerry products on Windows Mobile based devices.
