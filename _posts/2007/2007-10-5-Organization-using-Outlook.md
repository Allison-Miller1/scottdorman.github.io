A few days ago Scott Hansleman [talked](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingOrganizedWhileDrinkingFromTheOutlookFireHose.aspx) about how he's trying to keep the (apparently) massive amount of email organized using Outlook. He presents some interesting ideas, including creating folders that represent actions, a different inbox folder for each mailing list and separate folders for each project. Looking at my own Inbox, I think there are at least a few ideas here that I am going to try out and see how well they work.
