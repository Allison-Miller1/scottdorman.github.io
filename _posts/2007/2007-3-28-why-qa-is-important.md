For those of you who question why QA is important, here is proof.

The city where I live put up a new street sign last night at an intersection in downtown. The street is named Kennedy Blvd. In a mistake being called "human error" by the city's public works directory, the sign that was put up misspelled President Kennedy's name.

The mistake isÂ especially unfortunate because it is at such a high-profile intersection. The city will put up a corrected sign tonight. <br>
