Last month, I talked about the new [SnapShots]({% post_url 2007-04-16-snap-preview-anywhere-is-now-snap-shots %}) and mentioned that Snap is working on adding new SnapShots. They have added some new Shots and updated some existing ones.

PhotoShot™

PhotoShot puts an entire online photo album into a Shot. PhotoShots can be triggered by links to files hosted on Flickr, Photobucket, and Picasa Web.

Reuters CompanyNewsShot

The latest custom shot leverages Reuters' global news capabilities and the Snap Shots platform to deliver story headlines for publicly-traded companies. The Company News, updated in real time, is contained within a Snap Shot and is linked to the actual Reuters articles.

In addition to the new Shots, VideoShots™ now supports Google Video, Metacafe, Current.tv, and Revver, in addition to YouTube.
