The guys at GWB did an outstanding job migrating GWB to Subtext. Excellent work, Jeff, John, and Dru! They migrated over 1000 blogs and 3 years worth of content to the new site, so this was not a trivial change. There may be a few wrinkles to iron out, but so far everything is looking good. Hopefully these guys will be able to take the rest of the weekend and relax, I'm sure they've earned it.
