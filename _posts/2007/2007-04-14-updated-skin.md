With the upgrade of GWB to Subtext, I thought about updating my blog to one of the newer skins. There were several in the running, but eventually I decided to keep the original skin. I think this look gives a nice, clean feel and is easy to read. As a concession, I did rearrange the "News" section so the badges were grouped together in a way that makes more sense. As part of this slight cleanup, the Community Credit and Code Project badges now actually link to my profile on both of those sites.
