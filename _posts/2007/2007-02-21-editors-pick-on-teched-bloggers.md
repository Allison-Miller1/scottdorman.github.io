I just noticed that my [Tech·Ed Technical Tracks Summary]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-106567 %}) post was just listed as a TechEd Bloggers [Editor's Pick](http://techedbloggers.net/Editors_Picks.category) for Sunday, February 18.


I also received some feedback from Rob Relyea, the Program Manager for the WPF Team ([<font color="#000080">http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com</font>](http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com)) regarding my [<font color="#000080">Tech·Ed Technical Tracks - Where's WPF?</font>]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-106568 %}) post stating that they are working on fixing this issue. I'm looking forward to seeing the updated sessions covering WPF.<br>
