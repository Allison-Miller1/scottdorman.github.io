For those of you who might not know about the IASA, it is the premier association focused on the software architecture profession and promotes the advancement of best practice and education while delivering programs and services to IT architects of all levels around the world. The association is committed to improving the quality of the IT architecture industry by developing and delivering standards, education programs and developing accreditation programs and services that optimize the development of architecture profession. IASA membership consists of approximately 5,000 members located in over 40 countries. [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Software_Architects)]

Even though the IASA was established in 2002, there hasn't been a local chapter in the Tampa Bay area until now. Thanks to [Tom Fuller](http://soapitstop.com/), the chapter will have it's first meeting at the local Microsoft office on October 30 at 6:30 PM. This first meeting will discuss a number of topics about the group and what to expect going forward. Jeff Barnes (Microsoft Architect Evangelist) will also be presenting his session titled "The Role of the Software Architect".
