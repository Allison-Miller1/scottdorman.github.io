I finally felt it was time to put an "[About me](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/15/About.aspx)" type entry on my blog so you can get to know me a little bit better. There are already several links to various profiles that I maintain on LinkedIn, The Code Project, and Community Credit, but they don't really tell you who I am. I have also started to become more involved in the off-line community as well by speaking at different events.

As a result, I have consolidated a lot of the information available in the different profiles, added my speaking engagements, the open source projects I am involved with, and put it all together under one [profile page](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/15/About.aspx) available on my blog.
