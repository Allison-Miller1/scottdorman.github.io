I have updated my [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp)Â on Code Project for detecting what versions and service packs of the .NET Framework are installed. This is a relatively minor update that fixes a few typos I discovered while writing my latest [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/iisdetection.asp).
