I just received the confirmation email from Windows Live Gallery letting me know that my XFN Link Editor plugin is available for download. You can download it by going to [http://gallery.live.com/LiveItemDetail.aspx?li=217b89d0-30cb-4370-958e-f22307173ae0](http://gallery.live.com/LiveItemDetail.aspx?li=217b89d0-30cb-4370-958e-f22307173ae0).
