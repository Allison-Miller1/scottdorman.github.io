Hopefully I'm not jumping the gun, but I was just given a tentative "green light" to be able to go to [Tech·Ed](http://www.microsoft.com/teched) again this year.

This year, the focus will be on all of the newly released products, such as Vista, Exchange Server 2007, Office 2007, and ASP.NET AJAX. I'll see you there.
