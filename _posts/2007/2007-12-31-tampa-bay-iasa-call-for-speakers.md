The Tampa Bay International Association of Software Architects (IASA) is looking for speakers to present at our upcoming meetings. If you are a software architect in Tampa Bay or the surrounding areas, or are visiting from further away (or even out of state) and want to speak, please let me know.

Each meeting is broken up into two presentations:

*   Design Pattern Overview
*   Main Topic 

The design pattern overview is just that - an overview of a particular design pattern. I try to find a design pattern that complements the main topic, but that isn't always possible. This is an overview, so it's intended to provide a quick introduction to the pattern and briefly explain what it is and why you would want to use it. The overview presentation is intended to take no more than 25 minutes.

The main topic is a more "traditional" presentation. The topic should cover something related to software architecture and shouldn't act as a marketing session for a particular product or vendor implementation. This presentation is intended to take up to 75 minutes.

We aren't just looking for speakers from the Microsoft development and architecture communities, so if you're a Java architect (or any other language technology) and want to speak please let me know what your topic would be and when you are available.
