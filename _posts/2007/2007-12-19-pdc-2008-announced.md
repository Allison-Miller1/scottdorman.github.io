Pre-conference October 26, 2008      
Los Angeles, California

For those of you who don't know, PDC is the definitive Microsoft event for software developers and architects focused on the future of the Microsoft platform. 

Originally, Microsoft was going to hold PDC this year (2007), but in June Microsoft [announced](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/06/06/PDC-2007-Rescheduled.aspx) that it was being rescheduled to align with some of the major platform milestones. At that time, they didn't have the new event date.

As of last week, PDC 2008 was officially announced.

Mark your calendars and save the date. More information coming soon.
