In case you aren't familiar with UI for UWP, it's a suite of 20+ UI controls for developers building UWP applications. Be sure to check the [full list of available controls](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui).

In the last year, Windows 10 has seen growing adoption among desktop users and is now the second most used OS in the world, making up [about 25% of the market](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0).

Making UI for UWP open source makes an exceptionally strong statement from both Progress and Microsoft about the future of software development and developer tools.
