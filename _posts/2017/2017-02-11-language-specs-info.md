Microsoft recently announced the [language strategy](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/01/the-net-language-strategy/) for C#, VB, and F#. Part of this announcement was that the language specs for C# and VB are being made public in GitHub repositories.

This is actually really important for the language design process but it also allows anyone outside of Microsoft who is interested in reading (or even contributing to) the language specification to participate.

With that in mind, I'm happy to announce the [Language Specs website](http://www.languagespecs.info/). This is your "one stop shop" for finding the language specs of your favorite programming language. The specs themselves aren't hosted here, that's still up to the individual language maintainers. Rather, this is, at it's heart, a collection of links to the official language spec for the respective language.

The site itself, including all of the data, is open source in [GitHub](https://github.com/scottdorman/languagespecs.info). Right now, there are only a handful of languages, so if you want to contribute, simply [fork the repo](https://github.com/scottdorman/languagespecs.info/fork) and submit a pull request or [submit an issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/languagespecs.info/issues).
