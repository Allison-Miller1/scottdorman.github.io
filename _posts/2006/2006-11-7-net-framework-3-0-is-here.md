Earlier today Microsoft released the [newest version](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=10CC340B-F857-4A14-83F5-25634C3BF043&displaylang=en "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Redistributable Package") of the .NET Framework. If you have any previous beta versions installed, you must uninstall them before installing the final release. Make sure to install the Visual Studio 2005 extensions for [.NET Framework 3.0 (WCF & WPF), November 2006 CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F54F5537-CC86-4BF5-AE44-F5A1E805680D&displaylang=en "Visual Studio 2005 extensions for .NET Framework 3.0 (WCF & WPF), November 2006 CTP") as well. The earlier builds will not recognize the release version of the framework.
