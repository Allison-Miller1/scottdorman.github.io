I recently needed the ability to download a file from an arbitrary URL using .NET that was compatible in both .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0. What I found didn't meet all of my needs, so I decided to write my own.

As a result, I also posted my first [Code Project article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/filedownloader.asp)Â that contains the full details plus the source code. Please check it out and let me know what you think.
