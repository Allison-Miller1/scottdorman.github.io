As I was browsing around the [Subtext](http://www.subtextproject.com/) web site, I came across the [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com) website. This is a pretty interesting site, where the primary goal is "stupid prizes for smart people". From the website, the goal is

> ...to reward fellow IT Professionals who have contributed toward the development community. Currently, the rewards for these contributions are simply the satisfaction of helping colleagues in the development community. Now, they can be rewarded by recieving not only geeky gifts like a Swiss Army USB Drives, Caffeinated Hot Sauce or a Binary Wall Clock, but they also recieve a cool plaque to hang on their wall and impress their coworkers.
