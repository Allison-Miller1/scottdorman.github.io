I came across a reference to this on Code Project tonight while I was responding to some of the comments on my articles.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I like this idea. Maybe if we all go on strike until our companies adopt it? Hmm...then again maybe we should just send it to our IT departments and dev managers and let them fight it out.

There are a lot of comments posted, but if you read through them you will find some real shockers. Those definitely couldn't have been posted by developers...or could they?

The full Bill of Rights is [here](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html).
