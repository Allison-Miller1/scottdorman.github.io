After 2½ years at [Sunbelt Software](http://www.sunbelt-software.com "Sunbelt Software") I am changing companies and roles by moving to [BST Global](http://www.bstglobal.com "BST Global"). It sounds like an excellent opportunity for me and I am looking forward to starting the new year with a new company.

I won't go in to the details that led me to the decision to leave Sunbelt, but there are several rather significant events that have happened in the last several months (and especially over the last week) that led me to make the decision.

Moving to BST will allow me the opportunity to work with a smaller, although very well established, company that focuses on a single product suite rather than trying to cover a complete and disparate line of security products. I will be primarily responsible for working on the next generation release of their ERP software.

From the sound of the project, it is a very ambitious undertaking that has a huge potential to make the product even more successful than it already is.

I have certainly enjoyed the majority of my time at Sunbelt and the people I worked with there. On the same note, I am looking forward to working with a new development team. I wish Sunbelt and everyone there the very best of luck.
