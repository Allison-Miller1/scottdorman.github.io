title: Some strange job offers

In the past week, I've received three very unusual unsolicited job offers from [Monster](http://www.monster.com/). 

Now, I realize that a lot of companies advertise on Monster and even more of them troll the resumes that are there looking for candidates. Mostly, these are head-hunter types that send job offers in bulk.

These offers, however, caught my attention because they have **absolutely** nothing to do my skills or work experience. I've snipped the incriminating portions to protect the guilty.

The first one came from one of the local Nissan dealers. That's right, a car dealership. (By the way, this one was received on the 28th.)

> Congratulations! Based on your qualifications, we have selected you to interview withÂ *[removed]* Nissan. My name is *[removed]* and I am the *[removed]* for *[removed]*.

Tomorrow is the last day for interviews. Please view information below if interested please email back with a good time to interview.

The second one appears to be a financial services firm. If they were offering to do my finances for free, that would have been great...but no, they were trying to recruit me. Sounds like a great company to work for if I were a financial planner or stock broker.

Finally, yesterday I received the third (and hopefully last!) such email. This one was from a national lawn care company. 

> SUMMARY:
> Provides service to residential or commercial customers by making timely lawn/landscape applications, diagnosing and correcting lawn/landscaping problems through service calls and other customer communications.
>

It makes me wonder...just who do these companies have reviewing resumes?
