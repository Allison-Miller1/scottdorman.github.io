title: "Enterprise Library v3: Validation Application Block"

I just received an email pointing to Tom Hollander's blog posting "[Validation Application Block- Revealed!](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/11/27/validation-application-block-revealed.aspx)". (For those of you who don't know, Tom is a Product Manager for the patterns & practices group.)

The new Validation Application Block sounds very promising, allowing validation rules to be specified through the Configuration console (config files), as attributes in the code, as custom code, or any combination of the three.

The time frame hasn't been announced yet when we will have a source code drop that lets us actually use the new block, so it remains to be seen how it will best be used. As always, it looks like EntLib v3 will be far better than the previous releases.
