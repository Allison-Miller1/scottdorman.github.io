As a follow up to my [Implementing IDisposable and the Dispose pattern](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/idisposable.aspx)Â article, I have posted a new one on [SafeHandles and Constrained Execution Regions (CERs)](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/safehandle.aspx).

This article explains the new SafeHandle class, introduced in .NET 2.0, and how to use it. I also cover CERs and how they are used.
