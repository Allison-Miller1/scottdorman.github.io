I just saw in the latest issue of [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/) that Microsoft has hired veteran virus researcher Vincent Gullotto to head the Security Research and Response Team (SRRT).

Gullotto is a crack anti-virus researcher who has worked with McAfee and Symantec. He will become the general manager for the SRRT team, which handle all aspects of malware research and response.

It will be interesting to see how the other anti-malware players in the market respond to the news and even more interesting to see what Gullotto is able to do with his new team and who he is able to lure to Microsoft.
