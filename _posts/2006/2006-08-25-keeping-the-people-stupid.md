My wife was watching <u>Real Time with Bill Maher</u> tonight on HBO, when she heard the following statement:

> I hate to be a conspiracy theorist, but I swear to God, I think it's in the interest of corporations to keep the people stupid, and the best way to keep the people stupid is by having the people who inform them be even stupider.

That is perhaps one of the best quotes I've heard in a long time. For me, it ties with something I heard Dennis Miller say when I saw him live for one of my college homecoming concerts:

> Life is like a big, ugly, grizzly bear. If you lock eyes with it, it will kick your ass.
