For those of you who didn't get to go to Tech·Ed this year, Microsoft has made some of the webcasts and breakout sessions available free. It isn't everything that was presented at the conference, but it's what Microsoft considers the best (or most popular) topics. Unfortunately, for those of who did attend, the presentations from all of the breakouts aren't available yet on CommNet...still 3 weeks away.
