When [Geekswithblogs.net](http://www.geekswithblogs.net/) 2.0 is released (hopefully by the end of the year), it will be using a spinoff of .Text named [SubText](http://www.subtextproject.com). With the death of other great open source projects like NDoc, I decided to do my part and contribute as a developer on this one. I'm starting with reviewing and fixing the FxCop violations. So far, I've finished 2 of the projects.
