Microsoft just announced that it has purchased [Winternals Software](http://www.winternals.com/) and [Sysinternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/). Winternals is a leading provider of systems recover tools for Windows-based enterprises and Sysinternals is one of the leading community and enthusiast sites for people interested in information about the internals of the Windows operating system.

Winternals and Sysinternals were founded by [Mark Russinovich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich) and [Bryce Cogswell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Cogswell), both of whom will join Microsoft. Russinovich will join Microsoft as a Technical Fellow in the Platforms and Services Division, while Cogswell will join the Windows Component Platform Team as a Software Architect.

According to [Jim Allchin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Allchin), co-president of the Platforms and Services Division, “The work [Russinovich] and Bryce have completed in system recovery and data protection illustrates the depth of thinking and skill they will bring to future versions of Windows. The addition of their deep kernel-level expertise to our existing strong talent will help provide use with the edge we need to continue to raise the quality and functionality bar for Windows on both the client and the server.“

For now, the free Sysinternals tools will remain freely available but that may change at any time. I highly recommend grabbing them. According to Russinovich (and eWeek.com), “the fate of specific Winternals products is still being explored, but Microsoft is definitely interested in a number of products and technologies.”

The [Winternals Administrator's Pack](http://www.winternals.com/Products/AdministratorsPak/Default.aspx) will most likely live on as a separate product, but other products are likely to be integrated in to other Microsoft offerings.
