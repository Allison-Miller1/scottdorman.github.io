title: Hanging out a shingle...

I've finally had time and incentive to put out a real shingle on the web. Most of this is due to Microsoft's new [Office Live beta](http://officelive.microsoft.com/), which provides free domain name registration and hosting (on Microsoft's servers) for as long as I have my account. [Office Live Basics](http://officelive.microsoft.com/officelivebasic.aspx) is a little limited right now (and probably will continue to stay that way), but it will always be free.
