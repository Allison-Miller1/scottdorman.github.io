Even if you aren't a [Zune](http://www.zune.net/) fanatic, Microsoft has released a new [desktop theme](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75078) based on the Zune interface. The new interface is very similar to the one offered by [Windows Media Player 11](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx).

The theme is very clean and easy on the eyes. It installs as a desktop theme in the Display Properties control panel, so there is no extra software required in order to use it.
