I've been blogging here on GWB for almost 10 years and I've seen this community grow and change during that time.
I've enjoyed my time here but, for me, it's time to move on.

In that light, I'm moving to a [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) repository. There are a lot of advantages
for me in this move, but the primary ones are:

* I can use markdown for my posts
* I have full control over the layout using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* If anybody finds an issue with a blog post (a typo, incorrect code, whatever), you can click the edit button
and send me a pull request or simply log an issue

The GitHub repository is hosted at https://github.com/scottdorman/scottdorman.github.io. I'm working on getting
a proper domain name pointed to the blog, but for now the actual blog can be read at http://scottdorman.github.io.

At this point, the layout is almost complete. There are still a few tweaks to colors and such, but overall 
I'm pretty happy with it. (We'll see how long it is before I decide to change that though.) The layout is based
on [beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) and [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde),
both of which are pretty cool Jekyll based themes.

There may be broken links, so if you run in to any either submit a pull request or
[open an issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/scottdorman.github.io/issues/new). I also haven't moved any embedded
images over to the repository yet, so for now they all still point back to the GWB blog. I'll also be looking in
to ways to automatically redirect posts, hopefully in a way that doesn't require me editing every post. I expect both
of those to happen in the coming weeks.

I'll also be posting about how I moved the actual posts. Since I had over 600 posts, I wrote a pretty crude app
that handles the majority of the changes for me and then manually tweaked anything that caused Jekyll to fail.

Finally, I've turned off comments on all posts at GWB in favor of using Disqus on the new blog. Unfortunately,
I haven't seen a way to export the old comments from GWB so I can import them in to Disqus.
(If it's possible, please let me know!) 

I'm going to miss the GWB community but I'm looking forward to the next 10 years blogging on GitHub.
