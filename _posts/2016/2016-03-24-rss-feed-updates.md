If you were already subscribed to my blog using the RSS feed, you were using the feed available at
[FeedBurner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScottDorman). I've updated that feed to pull content from the new blog (here on GitHub), so you shouldn't have to do anything to continue
receiving updates.

I also updated the link in the blog footer to point to [FeedBurner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScottDorman) as well.
