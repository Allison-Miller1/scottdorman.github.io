I'm trying to put together my speaking schedule for upcoming code camps in the South East region. Right now I just want to know when the upcoming code camps are so I can determine which ones might best fit my schedule.

I only know of a few, so if you know of others please let me know.

1. Sorry guys! I would love to speak and show the family where I grew up, but I didn't know about this until just now which just isn't enough lead time.
2. Tentative date
3. Planned, not confirmed.
4. I know this isn't part of the South East, but I have family in that area.
