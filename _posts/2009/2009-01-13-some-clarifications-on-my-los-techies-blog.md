title: Some Clarifications on my Los Techies blog

It seems there has been some confusion and concern over my decision to also blog on the Los Techies website that I wanted to clarify. 

The most important point I want to make is:

> **For those of you who subscribe to my blog hosted on Geeks With Blogs (**[**http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman**](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman)**) there is no need to also subscribe to my Los Techies blog.**

My primary blog will continue to be here on GWB and all new posts will show up here first. What that means is that anything I blog here will eventually make its way to my Los Techies blog (since I have to manually cross-post the entries there may be a delay in some cases). That also means that everything you see on my Los Techies blog (with the exception of my [introduction post](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sdorman/archive/2009/01/10/introductions.aspx)) will be on my GWB blog.

To put it simply:

> **My Los Techies blog is a mirror of my GWB blog and will contain no new/exclusive content.**

(Sorry Los Techies, but I have a loyal following here and feel a certain amount of loyalty to GWB since I’ve been blogging here for the last 2 1/2 years.)

Right now I realize there is a certain “air of exclusivity” about the Los Techies site as you must be invited in order to host a blog. I hope that will eventually change and the site becomes a more open community.

If anyone feels strongly enough that I should only maintain one blog or has any other questions/concerns, please let me know.
