Ever since I started this blog it hasn't really had a title (or at least a subtitle) other than "blog". Thanks to [Stan Schultes](http://www.vbnetexpert.com/), I now have a new subtitle. This was born out of watching the CLR 4 Futures talk with Joshua Goodman at MVP Summit 2009 (the majority of which is also [available](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC49/) from the PDC 2008 site on Channel 9). Since I present a lot on .NET memory management, including a deep dive on how the GC works and how to properly implement IDisposable and the dispose pattern, he suggested the title "ephemeral segment." Looking around, it appeared that this wasn't already being used, so that is my new subtitle. Tell me what you think, including if you think that should become the main title for my blog rather than the subtitle.
