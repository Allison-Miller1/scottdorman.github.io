Microsoft today announced the new product line for Windows 7. In some ways the new Windows 7 product line follows the same ideas of Windows Vista, but the big differences are that each Windows 7 edition is a superset of the previous edition (which means that each higher edition will have every feature of all lower editions) and they will be focusing primarily on two editions of Windows 7: Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional.

The breakdown on the different editions is:

I know that looks like there are still a lot of different editions, but the key points are:

*   For Consumers: Microsoft recommends Windows 7 Home Premium for most customers and Windows 7 Professional for customers who want additional features and functionality useful for small business activities. 
*   For Businesses: Microsoft recommends Windows 7 Professional for most customers and Windows 7 Enterprise for medium-to-large business and enterprise customers that choose to license Windows through Software Assurance. 
*   The features in each version of Windows 7 build upon the one before it. As customers move up from one edition to the next, from Windows 7 Starter through Windows 7 Ultimate, they ***gain additional features and lose none***.
