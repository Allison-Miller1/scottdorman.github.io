I wanted to thank [Dave](http://geekswithblogs.net/dnoderer) and everyone else who helped coordinate the South Florida Code Camp this year. It was an excellent event and I believe the final number of attendees was a little over 700, which makes this the largest known code camp in the world.

For those of you who attended my sessions, thank you as well. As I mentioned, the complete list of resources for my two-part memory management session is [available](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2008/09/14/.net-memory-management-ndash-resources.aspx) as well as the [blog posts](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/category/6657.aspx) that are related to my Code Style and Standards chalk talk.

I am still waiting to hear about the recording for the memory management sessions, but if the audio came through OK, it will be available from the [INETA Live](http://live.ineta.org/) site.
