I’ve been very “heads down” working on my upcoming book from Sams Publishing, <u>Teach Yourself C# 2010 in 24 Hours</u>, so I haven’t been blogging as much as I usually do. In doing some research for the book, I’ve been taking an in-depth look at the .NET Framework and thought I would share some interesting statistics.

There are 18,435 total types in the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, with 13,995 classes, 1,216 interfaces, 2,100 enums, and 1,124 structs. The complete breakdown is shown below.

Of the 13,995 classes, 303 of them are exceptions. There are 227 public and 76 non-public exceptions. The complete breakdown is shown below.
