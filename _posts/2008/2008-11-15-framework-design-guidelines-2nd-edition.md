![5138dM4PHnL__SL500_AA240_](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/FrameworkDesignGuidelines2ndEdition_13D6E/5138dM4PHnL__SL500_AA240__3.jpg "5138dM4PHnL__SL500_AA240_")Those of you who know me know that I am a big proponent of code style and standards. One of the best resources I  have found for documenting a clear and thorough set of code standards is the [Framework Design Guidelines](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFramework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development%2Fdp%2F0321246756%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1216257857%26sr%3D8-1&tag=scotdorm-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) book by Brad and Krzysztof. 

The book was recently updated for the new language features in the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 releases. Some of the existing guidelines have been expanded with new annotations and more detail, and new guidance covering such features as extension methods and nullable types has also been included.

I was able to review an advance copy of this edition, and if you do purchase it (which I highly recommend) be sure to check out the last editorial review/quote on the first page. I’m very happy to say that my review quote made it in both the printed copy of the book and also the Amazon listing.

You should also check out the [PDC 2008 recorded session](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC58/) of Brad and Krzysztof talking about the guidelines from a “then and now” perspective. From the session abstract:

> Learn about guidelines that have helped the Microsoft .NET Framework grow into the most popular developer framework Microsoft has ever created. After ten years of use, we have an enormous amount of real customer data about what makes great framework design. Whether you are building your own framework or just want to get the most out of the .NET Framework, this is a must-attend talk! Join Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams, authors of the Dr. Dobbs award winning "Framework Design Guidelines" book, and get a sneak peek at the content from the 2nd edition (first available at PDC2008).
