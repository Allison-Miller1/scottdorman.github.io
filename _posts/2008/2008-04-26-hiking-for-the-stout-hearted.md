It's amazing how small our world can be sometimes. I just found this video from a tweet by [ScottHa](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), who was referring to a blog post by [Roy Osherove](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2008/04/25/i-m-a-wuss.aspx). The views are absolutely incredible (check out the view at about 00:40 and then again at 2:55), but there is no way I would ever do a hiking trip like this. Just watching this makes me feel afraid of heights (especially at 4:46), and I'm not!
