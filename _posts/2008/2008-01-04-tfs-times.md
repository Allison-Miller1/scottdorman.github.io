If you are an administrator or user of Team Foundation Server, there is a new monthly online newsletter you should check out called [TFS Times](http://www.tfstimes.com/news/). It started 2 months ago, and the January 2008 issue focuses on Team Build.

Looking at January's issue, this newsletter looks like it will be a good resource for information on working with and maintaining your Team Foundation Server.
