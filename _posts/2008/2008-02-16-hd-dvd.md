![Blu-ray Disc](http://www.blu-ray.com/images/bluray.gif)The HD DVD vs Blu-ray format wars appears to be over, in a relatively short amount of time too. [According](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1627196120080216) to Reuters, Toshiba announced that it is planning to stop production of HD DVD players and recorders.

The death-blow was apparently dealt by Wal-Mart's recent [announcement](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSWEN397220080215) that it is abandoning the HD DVD format and will carry only Blu-ray discs. About 4,000 U.S. Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores will phase out the HD DVDs by June. Wal-Mart's move comes close on the heels of Best Buy and Netflix deciding to carry only Blu-ray discs earlier this week.

Toshiba will continue selling HD DVD equipment for the time being, most likely until the supply runs out, but will not put resources into developing new devices.
