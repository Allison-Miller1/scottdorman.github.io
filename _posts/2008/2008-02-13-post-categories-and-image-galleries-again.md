You may have noticed that my post categories and image gallery lists are incorrect. I've submitted a trouble ticket to the GeeksWithBlogs technical support earlier this week, but it hasn't been resolved yet. Since I use the category list a lot to help find old posts, I decided to create a secondary [category and image gallery list]({% post_url 2008/2008-02-13-post-categories-and-image-galleries %}). Since I was recreating the lists, I have added a little bit of organization as well.

The full list is available as an [article]({% post_url 2008/2008-02-13-post-categories-and-image-galleries %}) since I will keep this list updated as I add or remove categories in addition to the automatic lists just in case this happens again.
