Silverlight 2 was just [released](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released.aspx) a few short months ago, but ScottGu is already providing [hints](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/16/update-on-silverlight-2-and-a-glimpse-of-silverlight-3.aspx) at what we will see in Silverlight 3 which is supposed to be out sometime next year and will be a major update.

*Some* of the major enhancements and improvements are:

* media enhancements (including H.264 video support)
* graphics improvements (including 3D support and GPU hardware acceleration)
* application development improvements (including richer data-binding support and additional controls)  

To go along with these enhancements, Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Web Developer Express will support a fully editable and interactive designer for Silverlight, and add tool support for data-binding.
