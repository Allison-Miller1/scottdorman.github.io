Normally the [Tampa Code Camp](http://tampacodecamp.com/) has already come and gone by this time of the year. This year, however, it's being held on December 6.

The official website and list of sessions has not been published, but it should be available soon. Be sure to [register](http://www.clicktoattend.com/?id=132006) now if you plan to attend. Last year attendance was capped at 600 and we're in a different location this time so I don't know what the limit will be.

### When & Where:
