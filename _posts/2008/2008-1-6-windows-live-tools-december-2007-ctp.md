I just noticed this [announcement](http://connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?ContentID=7286&SiteID=505) from last month, but if you are doing any Windows Live development you should check out the latest CTP release.The biggest improvement is that the CTP is now compatible with Visual Studio 2008 and the ASP.NET 3.5 Extension Preview. There are a lot of other changes in the CTP so be sure to check out the release notes.
