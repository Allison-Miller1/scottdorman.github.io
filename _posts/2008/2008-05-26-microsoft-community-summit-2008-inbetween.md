[![]inbetween[](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/MicrosoftCommunitySummit2008inbetween_A646/blogblingMAIN_meet_small_3.gif)](http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween)If you're going to Tech·Ed Developer or IT Pro this year,  be sure to come out to the [Microsoft Community Summit 2008](http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/) (also known as ]inbetween[ or the Tech·Ed Tweener Weekend, since it's in between the two events).

This is a 2-day free event hosted by the Florida user group communities for everyone who is attending one (or both) of the Tech·Ed events or anyone who wanted to go but wasn't able to. It's hosted at the Orlando Convention Center on June 7-8. Since it's a free event, **lunch will not be provided** (the cost was just way too high) but the vendors inside the convention center will be open so you can purchase food.

In case you don't know what ]inbetween[ is, think of SQL Saturday, .NET CodeCamp, Day of Silverlight, and ExamCram (plus a few other free community events) rolled together into two 8-hour days. We will have some speakers from Tech·Ed, the local development community and others covering a wide range of topics. I'm not on the schedule at the moment, but that may change.
