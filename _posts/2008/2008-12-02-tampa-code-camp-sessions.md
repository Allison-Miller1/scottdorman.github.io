[Tampa Code Camp](http://www.tampacodecamp.com) is this weekend and I'm presenting 3 sessions:

**Understanding Lambda Expressions**

> Lambda expressions are an integral part of LINQ and a powerful new feature of .NET 3.0. We will explore the history of lambda expressions and how they operate in .NET, and how they can dramatically simplify your code.Lambda expressions are an integral part of LINQ and a powerful new feature of .NET 3.0.

**Memory Management Fundamentals – Garbage Collection Deep Dive**

> Memory management in .NET is one of the fundamental aspects of .NET, yet it also seems to be one of the most misunderstood concepts in the CLR. Take an in-depth look at how .NET manages memory, allocates resources, and how the Garbage Collector works.

**Memory Management Fundamentals – IDisposable and the Dispose Pattern**

> Continuing the discussion on memory management in .NET, we'll re-cap the basics of how the garbage collection system works and then talk about the IDisposable interface and the Dispose pattern. This will cover not just how to use the pattern but also how to implement the pattern into your own classes.

For those of you who have attended my previous talks on memory management, be sure not to miss these as they have been updated and expanded with a lot of new content. The slide decks are available on [SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/) in my public [Presentations](http://snipurl.com/5leeg) folder.
