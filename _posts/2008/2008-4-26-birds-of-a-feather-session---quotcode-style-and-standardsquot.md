I am moderating a reprise of my BOF session at last year's TechÂ·Ed. This one is simply called "Code Style and Standards", and is BOF864. It's currently scheduled for Wednesday, June 4 from 7:45 PM - 8:45 PM.

Hopefully some of the people who attended last year's session will be at this one but I hope there are a lot of new faces as well.
