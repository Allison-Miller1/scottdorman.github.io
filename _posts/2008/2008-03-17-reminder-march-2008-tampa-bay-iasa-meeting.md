Just a reminder that the Tampa Bay IASA March meeting is next Thursday (March 27), starting at 6:30 PM. Mark Willoughby from [Symplified, Inc.](http://symplified.com) is presenting on Identity Management. This promises to be an interesting and informative presentation on the core principles and challenges faced when designing and deploying an Identity Management solution.

*In case you're worried, this is a non-sales presentation intended for business and security/IT professionals who are looking to cut through the noise and focus on the essential elements needed for a successful Identity implementation.*
