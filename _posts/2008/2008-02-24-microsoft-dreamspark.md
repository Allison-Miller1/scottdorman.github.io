Microsoft has always provided great deals for college students. I remember when I was still in school being able to purchase "Academic Editions" of Windows and Office at fractions of the retail price from the college bookstore.

This time around, Microsoft is making it even better to be a student with the introduction of Microsoft DreamSpark. DreamSpark gives students access to the same Microsoft developer and design tools used by the industry professionals **at no charge**.

DreamSpark currently offers the following:

***Developer tools***

*   Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition  
*   Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition  
*   XNA Game Studio 2.0  
*   12-month free membership in the XNA Creators Club 

***Designer tools***

*   Expression Studio, which includes  
    *   Expression Web  
    *   Expression Blend  
    *   Expression Design  
    *   Expression Media 

***Platform resources***

*   SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition  
*   Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition
