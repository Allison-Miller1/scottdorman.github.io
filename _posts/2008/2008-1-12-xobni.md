If you're wondering what Xobni is, it's "inbox" spelled backwards. But that's not all it is. They are a startup company founded in 2006 whose mission is "to take back the email inbox for our users". 

Â [![Xobni outlook add-in for your inbox](http://www.xobni.com/images/banners/formyinbox.gif)](http://www.xobni.com/?friend=29771) 

Their flagship product is called Xobni Insight and is an add-on for Microsoft Outlook. If you've used Lookout before, Xobni Insight appears to offer all that Lookout offered and then some. The nice thing is that it is available for both Office 2003 and Office 2007. Some of the features offered by Xobni Insight are:
