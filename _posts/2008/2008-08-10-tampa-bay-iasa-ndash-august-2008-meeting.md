The Web Service Software Factory (WSSF) Modeling Edition focuses on building the server side of a web services infrastructure, using either ASMX or WCF services. The new release uses three Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to model services: service contract, data contract and host models. Through use of these DSLs, WSSF helps developers construct a scalable, extensible web service framework from the service interfaces to the translation of domain data into business entities, and back! This session will get you jump-started in building your own services infrastructure using the WSSF from Microsoft Patterns & Practices group.

*Please be sure to register if you plan on attending the meeting. We use the registration numbers so we have an idea of how many pizzas to order. We also use the registrations as a “second chance entry” for the drawing at the end of the meeting (but you must register and show up, of course).*
