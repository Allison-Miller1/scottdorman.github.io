Axialis Software and Microsoft worked to create a free Visual Studio add-in to create an icon editing tool that allows you to create high-quality 256x256 PNG-compressed icons for Windows Vista. The editing experience, both inside and outside Visual Studio, is very easy to use and provides various tools, filters, and effects, as well as the ability to create icons from existing images or ready-to-use image objects.

***IMPORTANT**: Axialis IconWorkshop™ Lite installs ONLY if **Visual Studio® 2008 Professional** or **Standard** edition is present on your computer. Express, Trial or Older versions of Visual Studio are NOT compatible.
