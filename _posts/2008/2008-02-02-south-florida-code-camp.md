The South Florida Code Camp was today and there were around 600 people who showed up. I moderated a round-table discussion on code style and standards and presented an in-depth talk on memory management in .NET. For those who attended either one of my sessions (or just want to take a look at the slides) you can [download](http://cid-93d618d639ec9651.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/Code%20Camp/2008/South%20Florida) copies from my SkyDrive public folder.

I only managed to attend a few sessions, but talking with people at the after-party it sounds like everyone had a great time and was able to get a lot out of it.
