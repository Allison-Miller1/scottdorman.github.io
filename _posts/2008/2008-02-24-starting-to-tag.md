As you might have noticed, my last post included [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) tags. This blog has been listed with Technorati for quite a while now, but I've never actually tagged any of the posts. Even when Subtext added tag cloud support, I didn't bother with it. I'm not sure why I am now (perhaps the fact that the actual post categories aren't being displayed correctly has something to do with it), but I'm starting to add tags to my posts. I can't guarantee that every post will get them until tagging becomes second nature to me but I will try my best. It helps that Windows Live Writer can prompt me to add tags if I haven't already done so when I publish, but it would be really nice if tags were exposed in the same way as the categories.

I will not be going back through my earlier posts and adding tags to them (unless I get *really* bored).
