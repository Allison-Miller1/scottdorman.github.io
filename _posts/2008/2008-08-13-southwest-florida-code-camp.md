Another Florida Code Camp, this time in Southwest Florida (which is the Naples area). This is the first code camp for Southwest Florida, so be sure to [register](http://66.252.228.222/CreateNewWizard.aspx). When you register, you can sign up as a speaker as well if you want to get more involved in the community...speaking at Code Camp is a great way to get started as a speaker.

I'll be there speaking and possibly attending some sessions as well, depending on when things get scheduled. 

Here are the details:

**When:** September 13, 2008 - 8:00am to 6:00pm

**Where:** Lutgert Hall, Florida Gulf Coast University
