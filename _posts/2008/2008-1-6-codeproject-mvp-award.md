A few days ago, I [announced](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2008/01/01/microsoft-mvp-award.aspx) that I had been recognized as a Microsoft MVP. About 4 days later, I found out that I had also been awarded a CodeProject MVP.

This is certainly turning out to be a busy and exciting start to the new year!
