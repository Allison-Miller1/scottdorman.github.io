[![](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/CommunityCreditWinnerforDecember_9EE4/P15903_thumb_1.jpg)](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/CommunityCreditWinnerforDecember_9EE4/P15903_5.jpg) I have talked about [Community Credit](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/category/6304.aspx) before, and have been very impressed with the direction the site is heading. I was just notified that I won 4th place out of 7,721 members. This makes the fifth time I have won a monthly competition. 

The prize this time around is the T-bot Pen Drive. I'm not at all sure what to make of this one. It's a 1GB USB drive, but has beads and springs for appendages and a dust cover for a head. It's definitely a thumb drive with personality, but it's also one of the strangest things I've seen.

If you want one of your very own, they are available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FT-Bot-Pen-Drive-1GB-Blue%2Fdp%2FB000ZD21KE&tag=scotdorm-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scotdorm-20&l=ur2&o=1).
