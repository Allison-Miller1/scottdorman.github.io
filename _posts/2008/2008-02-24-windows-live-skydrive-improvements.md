I have [talked](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/10/12/Windows-Live-SkyDrive-Updates.aspx) about SkyDrive in the past and really like the service and the direction it seems to be taking. Just this past week, SkyDrive was finally officially released in 38 countries/regions. Along with the official release, the amount of space available has been increased to 5GB.

I love the increased storage space, hopefully we will start to see some of these other improvements soon:

1.  Increase (or, ideally, remove) the size limit on uploading files.
2.  The ability to download multiple files at one time, similar to the way we can upload multiple files using the upload tool.
3.  The ability to download an entire folder at one time.
4.  The ability to interact with my SkyDrive folders as if they were actual folders on the file system.
