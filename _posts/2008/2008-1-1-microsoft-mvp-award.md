The new year is certainly starting off on the right foot for me. I woke up this morning to an email from [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/) telling me that I [won](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2008/01/01/community-credit-winner-for-december.aspx) 4th place for December's competition. That was cool news (sorry David, but this slightly bigger news) until I saw another email from Microsoft telling me that I have received the 2008 MicrosoftÂ® MVP Award in the Visual Developer - Visual C# community.

This is my first MVP Award and I'm really excited about what it will bring over the course of the year.
