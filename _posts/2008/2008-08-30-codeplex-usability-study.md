If you want to help provide feedback for the next big features at CodePlex and will be in Redmond (Seattle) between September 16 – 19, be sure to [contact the CodePlex team](http://www.codeplex.com/ContactUs.aspx) to participate in some usability studies. Be sure to include your:

*   Name 
*   CodePlex username (if you have one) 
*   Phone number where we can contact you to schedule a time.   

I would love to participate as I have a few projects on CodePlex and spent a great deal of time talking with the team at this years MVP Summit, but unfortunately I’m not in the area. (Sara, any chance of Microsoft flying me out to participate? :) )
