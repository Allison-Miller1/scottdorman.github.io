Twitter is an interesting phenomenon. I first started using it in April at the MVP Summit. Since then, as anyone who is [following me](http://www.twitter.com/sdorman) has seen, my use has been intermittent at best. The biggest reason is that I haven’t found a ![outtwit_thumb](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/OutTwit_9E04/outtwit_thumb_3.gif "outtwit_thumb")Twitter client that I liked that allowed me to use Twitter in a way that was not only natural (at least for me) but from within tools that I was already using and in front of me.

 The other day I decided to download [OutTwit](http://www.techhit.com/OutTwit/) and have found it to fit almost all of my needs. There are a few things that could be improved upon which I’ve already submitted, but other than that it has worked exactly as advertised and I don’t have any complaints.

In case you’re wondering, the list of features (from the OutTwit website) are:
  <li>Update your Twitter status directly from Outlook. </li>  <li>Receive your friend updates as Outlook messages. </li>  <li>Archive, manage and search your tweets the same way you manage your email [(details)](http://www.techhit.com/faq.html#manage). </li>  <li>Assign custom folder and categories to new messages. </li>  <li>Automatically sort new tweets into per-sender folders. </li>  <li>Shorten URLs with [tinyurl](http://tinyurl.com/). </li>  <li>See graphs of your Twitter usage statistics. </li>  <li>Tweets sent to you (@replies and direct) are marked with high importance, so you can see them at a glance.</li>  

The best thing about OutTwit isn’t really that it integrates in to Outlook but rather that it pretty seamlessly integrates and makes use of a lot of Outlooks built-in features. You can have tweets delivered to a specific folder and can even have sub-folders automatically created for each person you receive a tweet from. You can search your tweet folders just like you search email, categorize incoming tweets, and generally interact with tweets the same way you normally would with email.

So far, it’s been the best Twitter client I’ve used. Hopefully my Twitter usage will go up now that it’s more natural. Now, I just need to find a good Windows Mobile client.
