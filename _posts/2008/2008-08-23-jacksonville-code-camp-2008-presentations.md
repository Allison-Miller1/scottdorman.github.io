For those of you attending the Jacksonville Code Camp 2008, the presentations for my sessions are available on my public Windows Live SkyDrive [folder](http://snipurl.com/jaxcodecamp08).

My sessions are:

|**Session**|**Time**|
|-----------|--------|
|Memory Management Fundamentals – IDisposable and the Dispose Pattern|8:30 AM– 9:30 AM|
|Code Styles & Standards (Open Space/Chalk Talk)|9:40 AM – 10:40 AM|
|Memory Management Fundamentals – Garbage Collection Deep Dive|2:15 PM – 3:15 PM|


Unfortunately, it looks like most of the sessions that I want to see are at the same time as mine, so I'll probably hang out in the speaker room or the public areas for a bit between sessions.
