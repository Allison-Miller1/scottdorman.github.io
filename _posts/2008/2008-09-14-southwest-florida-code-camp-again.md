It looks like the first code camp to be held in the “swamp coast” of Southwest Florida was a huge success. I think John and the rest of the crew that put this together did an excellent job. I haven’t heard final numbers yet, but they had 175 registered with 26 sessions and a morning of Open Space sessions.

As always, I presented two sessions on .NET Memory Management (thank you to the handful of people that attended and apologies for doing the sessions in the opposite order to how they were listed on the schedule) and an impromptu Open Space on code style and standards.
