Ever since the .NET Framework was first release, Microsoft has always recommended that your code be signed. Windows Vista drives this point home even more with UAC and the Windows Error Reporting (WER) features, not to mention the fact that it's a requirement for Vista logo certification. John Robbins from Wintellect provides an excellent [explanation](http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2007/12/21/code-signing-it-s-cheaper-and-easier-than-you-thought.aspx) of how to sign your code. As it turns out, it's a lot easier than many of you may have thought.
