> **SharePoint Architectural Perspectives**
> 
> While SharePoint does have the one-button install option, it isn't a monolithic application that just gets dropped on a server. SharePoint has a number of moving pieces that should be understood by both infrastructure and application architects. In this session, we'll review the architectural makeup of SharePoint's infrastructure, as well as the components of a custom SharePoint solution. A thoughtfully-designed SharePoint architecture can be the difference between smashing success and humiliating failure.
> 
> **Speaker:** David McNamee, SharePoint Technical Specialist, Microsoft Corp.
