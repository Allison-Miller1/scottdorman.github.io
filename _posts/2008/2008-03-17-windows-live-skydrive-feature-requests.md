I have been a big fan of SkyDrive since it was first available as a beta release. Now that it has been officially released, it has continued to get better. Just recently, the SkyDrive team [announced](http://skydriveteam.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!977F793E846B3C96!2410.entry) the top list of feature requests that they are looking to implement. The list so far is: 

*   Allowing multiple downloads at once.
*   Displaying how many times a file has been downloaded.
*   Supporting file synchronization from the desktop.
*   Providing an API for storing and retrieving files.
*   Adding SkyDrive access from Windows Explorer. 

The best thing about this list is that it covers all of the features that I have been requesting and wanting to see in SkyDrive. For me, the killer features for SkyDrive will be:

*   Providing an API for storing and retrieving files.
*   Allowing multiple downloads at once.
*   Supporting file synchronization from the desktop.
*   Adding SkyDrive access from Windows Explorer.
*   Tighter integration with [Windows Live FolderShare](http://www.foldershare.com). 

As you can see, 4 of my top 5 are also on the SkyDrive team's top 5. While there is no guarantee that these features will get implemented, they are asked about frequently enough to be "highly likely"...hopefully in the next few months as well.
