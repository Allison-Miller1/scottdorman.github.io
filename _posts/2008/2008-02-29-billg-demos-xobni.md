I have talked about [Xobni](http://www.xobni.com/) several times before and absolutely love this product. It turns out Xobni is a Microsoft [Startup Accelerator Program](http://microsoftstartupzone.com/accelerator/country.aspx?c=en) partner. There are lots of [benefits to the program](http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2008/01/microsoft-start.html) like free software, consulting help, press releases, introductions to Microsoft people, partners, and even VCs. One benefit that wasn't anticipated was a demo by Bill Gates at the Microsoft Office Developers Conference. Check out this [2 minute video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Mr5zOxG7wbU) of Bill talking about Xobni; then check out Xobni.
