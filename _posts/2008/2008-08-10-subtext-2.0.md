Phil just [announced](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/08/10/subtext-2.0-released.aspx) that [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) 2.0 is finally out. I havenâ€™t been very active on this release (sorry guys!) but with the plans for 3.0 starting up I will be getting back into things a bit more. The new 2.0 release looks really good and includes some new features and bug fixes that will be nice to have. Now, we just need to convince [Jeff](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/Default.aspx) and company to upgrade.

Some of the improvements are:

*   Enhanced MetaWeblog and WordPress API implementations
*   New CSS-based admin section
*   The ability to set a separate skin for viewing on mobile devices
*   CSS and JavaScript query optimizations
*   Future post support
*   OpenID support
*   Streamlined installation  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ba09c93e-7792-44e0-a435-e20a4c93599c" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">*Technorati Tags: [Subtext](http://technorati.com/tags/Subtext)*</div>
