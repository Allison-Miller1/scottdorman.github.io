I have been a big fan of Windows Live Writer since it was first available, and that continues with the [latest CTP release](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1508.entry). There have been a lot of changes between the last beta and this CTP, including some much needed UI improvements and new features, including:

*   Upload videos to Soapbox 
*   Image cropping and tilting 
*   Additional border styles 
*   Support for [LightBox](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/) and other image previewing effects (like Slimbox, Smoothbox, and others) 
*   Support for centering images 
*   Auto Linking 
*   Smart quotes/typographic characters 
*   Word count 
*   Tabs for view switching 
*   Improved category control with search/filtering   

There are also some SDK updates that will provide a lot of flexibility for plug-ins, including a new set of experimental API hooks for pre- and post-publish events. For more details about the SDK, check out the blog post on [Windows Live Dev](http://writerdevzone.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!FF912D98C958E9D3!170.entry). 

Iâ€™ll be updating my [XFN Link Editor](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=217b89d0-30cb-4370-958e-f22307173ae0&bt=9&pl=8) shortly to work with the new SDK.
