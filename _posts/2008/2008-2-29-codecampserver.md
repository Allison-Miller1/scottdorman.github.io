It's beginning to look like the [start](http://live.ineta.org/blog/2008/02/01/BringOnTheCodeCamps.aspx) of the Code Camp Season, with at least 12 scheduled over the next 4 months. If you are organizing a code camp, there is a new open source project that [Jeffery Palermo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/) has started called [CodeCampServer](http://codecampserver.org). The project aims to provide a solution that can server as the web site for a code camp and will be able to track and manage multiple conferences for a single user group.

The project will use the ASP.NET MVC Framework and the [MvcContrib](http://mvccontrib.org/). The project hasn't had their first release yet but are quickly working towards it. If you want to help, be sure to join the project.
