If you use Team System, [Accentient](http://widgets.accentient.com/default.aspx) has an excellent list of various Visual Studio Team System add-ins, add-ons, widgets, and extensibility solutions. This list is much more complete than the current [Visual Studio Gallery]({% post_url /2008/2008-02-06-visual-studio-gallery %} "Visual Studio Gallery"), but it has also been around a lot longer. One benefit of the Visual Studio Gallery, however, is that you get a description of the add-in to decide if it's something that is important to you.
