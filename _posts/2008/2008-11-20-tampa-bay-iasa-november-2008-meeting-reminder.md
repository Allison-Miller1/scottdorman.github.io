Just a quick reminder that the November 2008 meeting is tonight from 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM (ET) at the Microsoft office. We are very pleased to be holding this meeting in cooperation with the [Central Florida BizTalk User Group](http://eventbrite.list-manage.com/track/click?u=def661e5fb5b51ddb3bafdd75&id=4d3bebc255&e=5d2dfec64d). **Since this is a joint meeting, please _be sure to register_ so we have a good idea of how much pizza to order.**

Our speaker tonight is Danny Del Rio, a Senior Applications Architect specializing in enterprise integration. He brings extensive experience in various fields including manufacturing, healthcare, human resources and supply chain logistics. He consults for fortune 500 customers helping them design and build integration solutions based on BizTalk Server. He has participated in various MSDN web casts. You can catch him at [http://delriodanny.blogspot.com]() where he blogs about integration technologies.

We have two 1-hour topics tonight with a short break between. Both presentations cover BizTalk Server 2006R2. One session explores the concepts surrounding application integration and how BizTalk Server 2006 R2 can be a key player in your overall SOA strategy. The other session reviews some key aspects of SOA and shows how BizTalk can address those concepts.
