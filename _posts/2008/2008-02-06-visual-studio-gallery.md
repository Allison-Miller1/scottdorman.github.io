[![VSX](http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pmDlx-X6Gg9s8a45w2CEljvRLo1hebVvm35JZVfDzQn64NDBy9HhTVS1NtJ00NG78)](http://msdn.com/vsx/)I just came across the new [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.com/Default.aspx) site, which is a new showcase for products and extensions for Visual Studio. The gallery looks like it is mostly going to be focused on Visual Studio 2008, but there is a lot of content for VS2005 and earlier.

The gallery is part of the [Visual Studio Extensibility](http://www.msdn.com/vsx/) (VSX) Developer Center on MSDN. For those of you who don't know, VSX covers the Visual Studio Software Development Kit (SDK) including tools, documentation, and samples for developers to write, build, test, and deploy extensions for Visual Studio.

There are over 40 entries already in the gallery, mostly by Microsoft. Right now all of the Microsoft entries are free and the other third-party entries are either free, have a free trial, or require purchase.

It will be interesting to watch this gallery and see what else gets added.
