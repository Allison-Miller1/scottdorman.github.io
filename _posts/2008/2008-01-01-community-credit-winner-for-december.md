[![](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/CommunityCreditWinnerforDecember_9EE4/P15903_thumb_1.jpg)](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/CommunityCreditWinnerforDecember_9EE4/P15903_5.jpg) I have talked about [Community Credit](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/category/6304.aspx) before, and have been very impressed with the direction the site is heading. I was just notified that I won 4th place out of 7,721 members. This makes the fifth time I have won a monthly competition. 

The prize this time around is the T-bot Pen Drive. I'm not at all sure what to make of this one. It's a 1GB USB drive, but has beads and springs for appendages and a dust cover for a head. It's definitely a thumb drive with personality, but it's also one of the strangest things I've seen.

~~If you want one of your very own, they are available on Amazon.~~
