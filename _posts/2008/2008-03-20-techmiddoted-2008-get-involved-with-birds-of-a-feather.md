INETA is [once again coordinating](http://www.ineta.org/newsletters/2008_02.htm#A10 "February Newsletter") the Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) sessions at Tech·Ed 2008. Based upon feedback, the deadline for [topic submissions](https://www.msteched.com/dev/submitbof.aspx) has been **extended** to Wed 4/2/2008 and the [voting](https://www.msteched.com/dev/voting.aspx) deadline to Mon 4/7/2008. 

If you sign up to host two sessions and moderate one session OR host three sessions, you will get the following special BOF Volunteer Package including: 

*   A **Tech·Ed 2008 Day Pass** allowing access to all conference sessions, hands-on labs, meals, etc. on Wednesday 6/4/2008 (20 available on a first-come, first-served basis). 
*   Special BOF T-shirt. 
*   From all the volunteers, five of their user groups will get an <u>extra</u> INETA speaker between now and the end of 2008. 
*   Technology book from a major publisher. 
*   Attend a special lunch on Wednesday 6/4/2008 for an informal discussion with some technology experts like INETA speakers and individuals from the Microsoft product teams.
