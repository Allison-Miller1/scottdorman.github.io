[Tampa Code Camp](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/) is coming up in just two weeks, so be sure to [register](http://www.clicktoattend.com/?id=132006) now if you plan to attend. The speaker bios and full agenda haven't been published yet, but the list of sessions is now available. If you're going, be sure to check out my sessions:

**Coding Style and Standards (chalk talk)**

Code standards and styles are one of those topics that you either love or hate. Join your fellow developers as we talk about what our experiences have been, what worked, what didn't, and why having them is a good idea. Share your thoughts on what should be considered a standard and why it is important. Along the way we can discover some "best practices" and some creative ways to make adopting code standards at your company a little bit easier.

**Memory Management – Garbage Collection Deep Dive**

Memory management in .NET is one of the fundamental aspects of .NET, yet it also seems to be one of the most misunderstood concepts in the CLR. Take an in-depth look at how .NET manages memory, allocates resources, and how the Garbage Collector works.

**Memory Management – IDisposable and the Dispose Pattern**

Continuing the discussion on memory management in .NET, we'll re-cap the basics of how the garbage collection system works and then talk about the IDisposable interface and the Dispose pattern. This will cover not just how to use the pattern but also how to implement the pattern into your own classes.

**Understanding Lambda Expressions**

Lambda expressions are an integral part of LINQ and a powerful new feature of .NET 3.0. We will explore the history of lambda expressions and how they operate in .NET, and how they can dramatically simplify your code.Lambda expressions are an integral part of LINQ and a powerful new feature of .NET 3.0.
