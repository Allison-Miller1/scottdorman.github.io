Just a reminder that the Tampa Bay IASA February meeting is Thursday night (April 24th) starting at 6:30 PM. This is an open discussion meeting, so bring your architecture problems, and depending on how many people we have and how many problems we may split up into small groups or try to solve problems one at a time.

**Please be sure to register so we have an idea of how many pizzas to order**, and remember that the outside doors lock and the elevators need a security key after 7:00 PM.
