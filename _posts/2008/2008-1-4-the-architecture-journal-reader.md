For anyone that is a software architect in Microsoft technologies (and even those of you who aren't), [The Architecture Journal](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/default.aspx) is a must read. If you aren't familiar with it,  

> The Architecture Journal is an independent platform for free thinkers and practitioners of IT architecture. New editions are issued quarterly with articles designed to offer perspective, share knowledge, and help you learn the discipline and pursue the art of IT architecture. The Architecture Journal reaches over 53,000 subscribers worldwide.

You can receive a [free print version](https://www.msarchitecturejournal.com/default.aspx) or you can try out the new beta release of the "[Architecture Journal Reader](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dd466bbb-1b7d-438e-9f9a-954ce2058f15&displaylang=en)". The reader demonstrates many of the user interface principles that have been highlighted in recent issues and really starts to showcase the power and flexibility of a WPF application in a line-of-business style application. The reader is a locally installed application that provides a version rich, immersive, searchable, and easy-to-read experience for each issue of the Journal. It automatically synchronizes itself so that you will automatically have access to the latest Journal issues without needing to download the PDF files or check online. 

If you read the Journal, I highly recommend installing the Journal Reader.
