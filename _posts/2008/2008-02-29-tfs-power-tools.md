With the release of TFS 2008, Team Build is getting closer to providing the same features as [CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET). To help remove some of the shortcomings of Team Build, Microsoft has released the [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Team Foundation Server Power Tools](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/tfs2008/bb980963.aspx), which is a set of enhancements, tools and command-line utilities that improve the Team Foundation Server user experience.

Team Foundation Server Power Tools includes the following tools: 

*   [Team Foundation Power Tool command-line tool (TFPT.EXE)](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#tfpt) 
*   [Build Notification](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#build) 
*   [Process Template Editor](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#pte) 
*   [Custom Check-In Policy Pack](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#checkin) 
*   [Team Foundation Server Best Practices Analyzer](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#bpa) 
*   [Work Item Templates](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/#wit)
