Did you miss PDC this year? Don't want to watch the [recorded sessions](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/)? Then register today for an MSDN Developer Conference near you!

The MSDN Developer Conference (MDC) brings you the best content of the PDC presented by your local field evangelists and community influentials (mostly Microsoft MVPs). The conference is broken down in to 3 tracks: 

*   Azure Services Platform 
*   Client and Presentation 
*   Tools, Languages, and Framework   

The MDC is a one-day "best of" conference that costs $99.00. If you didn't make it to PDC you won't want to miss the MDC, so be sure to [register](http://www.msdndevcon.com/Pages/locations.aspx) today.

If you are in Florida, the MDC is in [Orlando](http://www.msdndevcon.com/Pages/orlando.aspx) December 11, which is right around the corner. Be sure to register now before space fills up.
