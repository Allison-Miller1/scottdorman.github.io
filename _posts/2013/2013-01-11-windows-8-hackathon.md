***Windows reimagined. Extraordinary apps.***

Combining the broad reach of Windows, best-in-class developer tools, a re-imagined user experience, and a built-in store, Windows 8 is the largest developer opportunity — ever.

***Are you ready?** *Then [join us](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5065617398/sdorman) for this free, full-day event filled with coding, sharing, plenty of food, and perhaps the occasional Lightning Talk on topics determined by your apps and questions.

**FAQs** 

**What is a hackathon?**

These hackathons are a really fun way to get "down and dirty" with the technology and experience development along side others in the same room. It's an open Windows 8 code fest, where you'll put what you know into practice and be eligible to win some great cash prizes! Code to your heart's content, with Windows 8 experts available to guide you through every step of the process. It's the perfect opportunity to get your dream application underway, or to finish that app you've already started.

**What do I need to bring to the event?**

You will need to bring a photo ID, your registration, a computer with [Windows 8](http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200094046) and [Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2012-express) (or any of the commercial editions of Visual Studio 2012), and your Windows 8 app idea (or a partially completed app, if you have one). 

**What are the prizes?**

We have three cash prizes:

*   First place is **$1000.00**
*   Second place is **$500.00**
*   Third place is **$250.00**

Winners will be responsible for taxes (if any) and you *must be present to win*.

**Who are the judges?**

Judging will be performed by a panel of 3 judges (still being determined) and will be based application completeness and how well the application follows the Modern UI principles.

**Who are the sponsors?**

We wouldn't be able to host this event without our corporate sponsors. They are providing us everything from food to prize money.
