We are still ironing out some contract issues with Microsoft legal to include the Express Edition DVD with the book, but in the meantime there will be about 9 galley copies of the book which Sams will be giving away during TechEd 2010. If you’re going, be sure to stop by the Sams booth for the details on the giveaway*.

Once the contract issues are resolved, the book will be officially available for purchase, but you can pre-order it now from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672331012?ie=UTF8&tag=scotdorm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=) or your favorite online book-seller. Be sure to [become a fan](http://www.facebook.com/pages/edit/?id=331032551363#!/pages/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Visual-C-2010-in-24-Hours/331032551363) too.
